Coding Examples

This contains examples of code that I have produced both academically and professionally.  All of these are for financial
applications.

main.cpp:  large data set analysis program.  It is an automated trading program that makes decisions based off of 
the factors found in data2.txt.  It rebalances a portfolio of given size each month, and after the designated time, 
will display information important to the portfolio manager.

PortfolioSimulationTrials.R:  Creates and backetests portfolios and creates outputs for how well each portfolio did over 
the range of the data set (15 years or so).

EuroMonteCarlo.cpp:  uses crude monte carlo and boost to price a european call or put option.

AsianOptionVarianceReduction.R:  uses different monte carlo methods to price different options from european to asian.
Methods used such as Antithetic, Control, and Stratification.

data2.txt and smallcap.csv:  data files used in the above functions.
